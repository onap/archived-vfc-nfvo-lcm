This process is ns instantiation process
When the NS and vnf packages are uploaded and the MSB is registered successfully.
the instantiation operation begins.
This process mainly includes ns creation, instantiation, information query acquisition,
instance termination and data deletion after termination.

# create

Prepare the data before instance creation according to your needs,
and replace the CSAR ID generated after uploading package management.
When the execution is completed, an instance ID and other data are returned.

# instance

This process also prepares the data according to the requirement of creating the instance itself,
returns the instance ID after executing the create script,
and then executes the script after executing the script command. At this point,
the instance ID will be passed into the script, and a series of instantiation operations will be started,
and the virtual machine will be created.

# get

If you want to get some data generated during instance creation, you can execute the script
The script can query all the instance information in the database.

# get_one

If you want to get some instance data during instance creation, you can execute the script
The script only queries the content of an instance information,
executes the script command and puts the created instance ID after the command,
then the query can be completed.

# terminate

After the instantiation process is successfully created,
if you want to terminate the instantiation, execute the script.
The virtual machine generated after the script execution will also stop,
as well as some data deletion, termination of services.
After the script command is executed, the instance ID needs to be added after the command.

# delete

Some data will remain after termination. Execute the script to clear the data in the database.
The instance ID is also required to execute this process.
The completion of this process indicates the end of an instance creation termination process.

Note: You should configure the IP and CSAR file path of MSB in const file
      IP address for MSB service
      NS cannot be created repeatedly
      Update test scripts of ns_instance
      The request mode of MSB is HTTPS, and the port of public IP is 30283
